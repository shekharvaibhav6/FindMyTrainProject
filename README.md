Find My Train Project

FindMyTrainProject is a Java-based application designed to provide real-time tracking and information on trains, utilizing object-oriented programming principles and the Java Collection Framework. The project focuses on delivering efficient and scalable train management and tracking by leveraging OOP concepts for modularity and extensibility.

Features

Real-time Train Tracking: Provides current locations and status of trains.
Search and Filter: Search for trains based on train numbers, routes, and stations.
Efficient Data Handling: Uses Java Collection Frameworks (e.g., HashMap, ArrayList) to manage train schedules and related data.
OOP Design: Structured around classes that encapsulate train information, schedule details, and route tracking.
Technologies

Java: Core language for the project.
Collection Frameworks: Utilize HashMap, List, and other collections for managing large datasets.
OOP Concepts: Designed using object-oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to maintain flexibility and scalability.
Usage

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and execute the FindMyTrainProject.java file.
3. Enter the train number or station details to find the train information and status.
4. Installation

Make sure you have:

1. Java 8 or higher installed.
2. A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) to run the project.
